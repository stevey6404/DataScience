### This is my first time programming in R.
### Despite coming from a non-computing background, I was able to pull through with Week 4's assignment. ###
### Although my code may not be as fancy/efficient as people with a computing background or people with basic knowledge in R, I was able to apply the knowledge I've learnt in this course to solve the problems in a systematic way. ###
### I thoroughly enjoyed every step of it! ###
